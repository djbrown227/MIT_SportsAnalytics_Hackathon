## Project Title: Hockey Defense Dynamics: Unveiling Insights with DD Metric

### Introduction:
Welcome to our project repository! Our project, presented at the prestigious MIT Sports Analytics Hackathon, focuses on hockey defense dynamics, aiming to revolutionize strategic gameplay through the innovative use of data.

### Objective:
Our primary goal was to explore the relationship between defensive strategies and key performance indicators in hockey, with a particular emphasis on the role of defenders. To achieve this, we introduced a novel metric called DD (Defensive Distance), designed to quantify defensive strategies with precision and granularity.

### Key Questions:
Our investigation centered around two fundamental questions:

1. **Scoring Correlation:** Is there a discernible correlation between DD and scoring outcomes?
2. **Counter-Attack Influence:** Does DD influence the frequency and success of counter-attack shots?

### Methodology:
We meticulously analyzed hockey gameplay data, focusing on structured attacks—instances where all players from both teams congregated on the same side of the ice. By scrutinizing player positions and goal attempts, we extracted insights to address our key questions.

### Findings:
Our analysis, powered by advanced statistical techniques including logistic regression, yielded intriguing results:

1. **Scoring Impact:** Through logistic regression analysis, we discovered that an increase in DD, indicative of a more conservative defensive approach, was associated with a decreased likelihood of scoring. This finding challenged conventional wisdom and underscored the dynamic nature of defensive strategies in hockey.

2. **Counter-Attack Dynamics:** Surprisingly, logistic regression revealed that augmenting DD also led to an increase in counter-attack shots. This unexpected finding suggested that a more conservative defensive stance might inadvertently create opportunities for swift offensive retaliation.

### Future Directions:
We outlined several avenues for future exploration and refinement:

- **Expanded Dataset:** Testing our hypotheses with more extensive and diverse datasets to enhance the robustness and generalizability of our conclusions.
- **Convex Hull Analysis:** Drawing inspiration from methodologies utilized in other sports analytics domains, particularly the NBA, we proposed delving deeper into the concept of Convex Hulls. This approach could provide deeper insights into defensive and offensive dynamics in hockey gameplay.

### Conclusion:
Our project represents a pioneering effort to unlock the mysteries of hockey defense dynamics through data analytics. With DD as our guiding metric, we've laid the foundation for future advancements in strategic gameplay and performance optimization. Join us on this journey as we continue to push the boundaries of sports analytics and innovation.
